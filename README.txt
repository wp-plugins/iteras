Integration with ITERAS, a cloud-based state-of-the-art system for managing subscriptions and payments for magazines.

== Description ==

ITERAS is a complete system for managing subscriptions for print and digital magazines. We automate as many of the hassles of billing as possible and offer you a choice of a wide range of billing methods.

For more information, check out [iteras.dk](https://www.iteras.dk/).

This plugin allows you to quickly set up a paywall in WordPress, integrating with your ITERAS subscriber base. All you have to do is set up a landing page for visitors who are not logged in.

The plugin uses the ITERAS Javascript API that also allows further customizations if you need it.

== Installation ==

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard and either upload the plugin (if you have already downloaded it) or search for "ITERAS" in WordPress plugins, then click "Install Now".
2. Activate the plugin in the plugins dashboard.
3. Go to the plugin settings (either from the dashboard or from Settings->ITERAS) and fill in the requested details. You'll need to setup a landing page for the paywall.
